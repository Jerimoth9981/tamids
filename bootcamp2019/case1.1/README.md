# St. Louis County Segregation Analysis

This repository contains analysis and data notes used for the August 20, 2014 BuzzFeed News article "[The Ferguson Area Is Even More Segregated Than You Probably Guessed](http://buzzfeed.com/jsvine/the-ferguson-area-is-even-more-segregated-than-you-thought)."

## Data

The data for this analysis comes from the American Community Survey's 2012 5-year data, via [American Fact Finder](http://factfinder2.census.gov/). Specifically, it comes from tables DP03 (employment), DP04 (housing), DP05 (race), and S1701 (poverty).

Since it's a lot of data (several hundred megabytes), it's not included directly in this repository.

## Analysis

Analysis for this project was conducted in an IPython notebook, the raw version of which can be found [here](notebooks/segregation-analysis.ipynb). A rendered version of the notebook, can be [viewed here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/buzzfeednews/2014-08-st-louis-county-segregation/blob/master/notebooks/segregation-analysis.ipynb).
